    <h1>One Last Thing...</h1>

    <p>
      This website is just a small effort,<br />
      but every word, every photo,<br />
      and every feeling here is real.
      <br /><br />
      Thank you for being you.<br />
      Thank you for existing.<br />
      And thank you for making my world a better place.
      <br /><br />
      Happy Birthday ❤️
    </p>
